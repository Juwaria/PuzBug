PuzBug- Making Debugging Fun!

This is a standalone game for learning the basics of debugging. An important aspect in programming is detection/finding the bug, its location and cause of its occurrence. Debugging is an integral part in software development. It refers to finding the
errors in the code and fixing them. As a software developer, one must possess this skill. The
goal of our project was to develop a game called ‘PUZ-BUG’. As the name suggests, it a
combination of puzzle and debugging. Our aim was to make learning fun and at the same time
teach the students the skill of debugging.
